        <p class="poems">
          Every millennial tear was made out of a feather,<br />
          the same feather that teased everyone on getting over<br />
          the biggest fear using the happiest idea;<br />
          We start making promises, dinning every skin under that cardigan,<br />
          ribbons of that little joy, we conquered the fabrics of this millennial season.<br />
          <br />
          Every moon-shaped hole has its concrete father,<br />
          enough I said it seven times,<br />
          I met this violence on an intersection of this unyielding ground<br />
          we paint his name as an institutional corporate head,<br />
          he'll send us the money to buy christmas present.<br />
          We made him a delightful joy that the mother will like and will likely to tease to flirt,<br />
          for himself, he will get a big big smile.<br />
          <br />
          The rain grows thicker with shades, the hole leans to incomplete,<br />
          for father to put on the stocking of concrete,<br />
          we had to withdrawls things from his corporate equity.<br />
          So father I say, do not render, go on a quest of whisper,<br />
          you'll meet what I've dreamt in a glance like a whisper,<br />
          and get to sleep on what I've slept on for years that passed like a whisper,<br />
          no need to be afraid like a whisper, it is careless and relentless,<br />
          you'll see what say as a child as I was.

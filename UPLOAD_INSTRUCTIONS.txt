UPLOAD THIS TO REPO ROOT (so the site works)

1. Go to github.com/babe123333/pobum
2. Delete or move the old "liminal_site" folder if you want a clean start
3. Add file → Upload files
4. Drag ALL of these into the upload area (not the folder - the FILES inside):
   - index.html
   - styles.css
   - player.js
   - .nojekyll
   - the entire "assets" folder (drag the folder so it uploads as assets/)
5. Commit changes

Your site will be at: https://babe123333.github.io/pobum/

(Settings → Pages: Source = Deploy from branch, Branch = main, Folder = / (root))

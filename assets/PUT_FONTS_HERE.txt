Put your font files in this folder:

  liminal_site/assets/

For this site to use your fonts, these files must exist here (exact names):

  Ogg-Light.ttf
  CanelaText-Regular-Trial.otf
  CanelaText-ThinItalic-Trial.otf

Then refresh the site.

Put your font files in this folder:

  liminal_site/assets/

This website is set up to look for a font named:

  Ogg-Light.ttf    (your current file works)

  ogg-font.woff2   (best)
  ogg-font.woff
  ogg-font.otf
  ogg-font.ttf

Note: ".ogg" is an audio format, not a font format.

After you add the font, refresh:
  http://localhost:8000/liminal_site/
